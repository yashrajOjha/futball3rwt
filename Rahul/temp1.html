                During Kovac's time at Bayern , the team scored 2.67 and conceded 1.43 goals per 90' , it was arguably the worst Bayern side in history. Following his sacking We have seen the German giants score 3.19 and concede 0.85 goals per 90. </br>
                OOF ! and all the credits go to one man Hansi Flick.</br>
        
                - While attacking AD moves further up the pitch(LW) while the other full back plays as a RWB, who rushes forward only when needed , the wingers play as CAMs just behind the striker , this means there are 5 Attackers in or around the box , one of the midfielder stays on the edge of the box as a cover. </br> 
                This flexible positioning helps in effective high pressing thus outnumnering the opposition's press</br>
                - When in possession of the ball Kimmich drops back to form 3ATB , while the other CM covers them  , around 5-6 players crowd one of the flanks which pushes the opposition towards them , this creates space on the other flank which is then exploited by the eagle-eyed midfields who launch the ball forward for mindboggling attacks.
                </br>- Best Players :</br>
                1. Robert Lewandoski : all I can is for me he would have won the BallonD'or if it wasnt cancelled.</br>
                2. Thomas Muller: the Raumdeuter has experienced renaissance since Flick took over.</br>
                3. Joshua Kimmich : arguable the best Right back on the planet</br>
                4. Alphonso Davies : emergence of the Canadian left back is commendable</br>
                5. ManWALL Neuer : the name says it all</br>
        
                The UNDERRATED one : Serge Gnabry cant believe arsenal let him go for 5M euros

            <p>
                Mourinho's Inter had a clear idea, dominating your opponents doesn't just mean playing aggressive attacking football or having the most possession, it can also be achieved by smart defending, breaking your opposition's passes, and not letting them create chances to score a goal.</br> 
                Let's talk about a team known for its defensive dominance, let's talk about the Nerazzurri, let's talk about Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan.</br>

                Jose Mourinho set up his team in a 4-2-3-1 formation, Júlio César was the man between the sticks, with club captain Javier Zanetti occupying the left-back spot (also played in the midfield when required), 
                he stayed back being the more defensive fullback, Maicon was an attacking fullback occupying the right flank and every time he bombed forward Cambiasso would cover for him, Maicon excelled in whipping in those low driven crosses for the attackers to pounce upon. </br>
                The center-back pairing of Lucio and Samuel was rock solid. They were more traditional CBs playing mostly short passes to their midfielders instead of launching those long balls but this lack of ball 
                progression was dealt with by the pivot of Cambiasso and Motta/Stankovic.</br>
                Cambiasso was urged to play the balls very quickly so that the attackers could take it to the goalkeeper before the opponents could regroup defensively. The other midfielder in the pivot would be either Stankovic who was more offensive and aided Sneijder or Thiago Motta who was capable of playing in various other midfield positions due to his tactical intelligence and versatility.</br> 
                Once Cambiasso launched the ball forward Sneijder would then use his ability to find Milito or Eto'o(who would drift in as Maicon moved forward). Mourinho's side made no urgency in gaining back the ball as they would sit deep and wait for an opportunity to counter-attack clinically.</br>
                Sneijder would also drop back in midfield to overload it and win the ball back which proved to be instrumental in big games, he would dictate the games playing as a CAM.</br> Samuel Eto'o and Pandev played crucial roles in their position, they played as defensive wingers(apart from drifting in when fullbacks joined the attack), they
                fit into Mourinho's system of play really well at the expense of their attacking prowess.</br> At times even Cristian Chivu would be deployed as a defensive left midfielder. For Diego Milito, I have no words, scored two past Bayern to seal the third UCL title for the Nerazzurri.</br>
                </br>
                ***“It’s not important how we play. If you have a Ferrari and I have a small car, to beat you in a race I have to break your wheel or put sugar in your tank.” - The Special One***
                </br>
                </br>
                Under Mourinho, Inter controlled the games defensively, they were arguably one of the best Italian sides. With the Scudetto, Copa Italia, and UCL in the bag, Inter became the first Italian team to complete the treble.</br> Offense wins you matches and defense wins you titles.</br>

            <span class='hcontainer'><p class="heading">Real Madrid</p></span>
            <p>
                Formation : 433, **When in possession** Real Madrid would dominate their opponents outside the area, using Modric's and Kroos's vision and passing to switch the ball from side to side, to set the fullbacks getting behind defences, this would let the front three of Bale-Benzema-Ronaldo to crowd the penalty area and then receive a cross from either of the fullbacks or give through balls to the likes of Ronaldo or Gareth Bale, who would then get behind the defenders and set up a teammate for a goal. Players would be very patient during the build-up, which would draw the opponents towards them and force them to make a mistake which would then be exploited by the front three.</br></br>

                **When out of possession/ when they lose the ball**: The team would apply pressure usually centrally. If the press failed the team would drop back in their own half, having a formation of 4-5-1, flooding the midfield and once the possession was regained Bale and Ronaldo would use their explosive speed for counter attacks with Benzema making some crucial passes (linking up the play), along with the attackers one of the fullbacks would come in to support.</br></br>

                Madrid had the same midfield in all the three CL finals (2016,17,18), Casemiro (to me he is the best defensive midfielder) dominating in the big games, he helps Madrid in sitting deep, breaking up the play, and start the counter-attacks, because of the attacking nature of the full-backs Casemiro ensured that the opposition doesn't counter-attack.</br></br>

                Modric, the link man, he applies pressure from the front, he would keep the passes short and effective and this would prove to be destructive in the final third. He linked Madrid's midfield and their attack. Dribbling was his main asset, and he can use it to help his side beat an opposition press and then feed the attack.</br></br>

                Toni Kroos would control the tempo of the game, with him being the orchestrator of many attacks. Kroos’ passing range and accuracy are very impressive. He would arrive late around the penalty area and bend it in the corners for a goal.</br></br>

                Sergio Ramos would break the play, and his ability to defend 1on1 is exceptional. Ramos covers depth in standard situations with ease, constantly manipulating his defensive positioning in slight ways to the tune of his surroundings. A man to mark in case of set pieces, Ramos' bullet headers are pinpoint.</br></br>

                Carvajal and Marcelo both played vital roles in the success of this side. Because they are both dangerous in the attacking third, their presence naturally opens on space for players like Isco, Bale, and Ronaldo to exploit. Marcelo is a complete fullback with excellent dribbling, very athletic, and has great ball control.</br></br>

                The trio of Bale, Benzema, and Ronaldo would give nightmares to defenders with their ruthless goal-scoring ability. Benzema would drop in as a false nine giving CR7 and Bale the space to exploit defenders, Bale would use his raw pace and acceleration to ease past the defence, and to explain what the GOAT does in a few words is a difficult task. He would turn on the beast mode in big matches, his ability to step up in big games is unmatched.</br></br>

                What Real achieved in those years is a feat difficult to replicate, it probably won't be repeated for many years. Zidane had a winning formula, his tactics were simple with the greatest team ever.

            <p>
                The backline of Evra, Rio, Vidic, and Brown was consistent with all of them playing 32 games or more in the Premier League. The width was crucial as Evra and Brown would move forward when necessary, Evra was the more flamboyant one who would bomb forward and Brown would slide into the midfield three (while attacking).</br>
                Vidic played as a more aggressive centre-back, winning back possession with strength and inch-perfect tackles, while Ferdinand was calm, composed, and read the game well. He was comfortable on the ball, launching them for counter-attacks.
                The midfield pivot of Scholes and Carrick sat deeper during important matches, Carrick would screen the defence while Scholes was the deep-lying playmaker, playing a bit further up the pitch than Carrick. Scholes from that position would dictate the games using his passing range and technical ability.</br>
                The right flank was mostly occupied by Ronaldo, but when the team needed defensive solidity, Tevez moved out of the 11 with Ronaldo going up top, and Ji Sung Park/Hargreaves coming in for the RMF role, they contributed to a disciplined midfield. As said earlier United did not press aggressively, the team relied on individual ability to win the ball back and break a pass while reading the game.</br>
                Giggs would start on the left but slowly would move in for Evra to make overlapping runs. Whilst the trio of Ronaldo-Rooney-Tevez would obliterate defences, they were versatile and could play anywhere up top, this would make it difficult for the opposition to mark them.</br>
                Rooney and Tevez had a high work rate meaning they would drop back to collect the ball and then drive forward, this pulled the opposition backline higher, allowing space for United to attack. The trio contributed to 71% of United's goals that season with Tevez and Rooney doing their best, Ronaldo was doing what he has been doing for the past 15 years.</br></br>

                This was one of the best United sides to have graced the Premier League and Europe, led by Sir Alex, the show they put on was an absolute masterclass for the audience. Tactically aware and brilliant in every area of the field, this was how United dominated games.</br>
