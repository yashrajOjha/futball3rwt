            <span class='hcontainer'><h4 class="heading">Hansi Flick's Bayern Munich 2019/20</h4></span>
            <br>
            <p>During Kovac's time at Bayern , the team scored 2.67 and conceded 1.43 goals per 90' , it was arguably the worst Bayern side in history. Following his sacking We have seen the German giants score 3.19 and concede 0.85 goals per 90. OOF ! and all the credits go to one man Hansi Flick.</p>
            <h5>Attacking Phase</h5>
            <p>While attacking AD moves further up the pitch(LW) while the other full back plays as a RWB, who rushes forward only when needed , the wingers play as CAMs just behind the striker , this means there are 5 Attackers in or around the box , one of the midfielder stays on the edge of the box as a cover.  This flexible positioning helps in effective high pressing thus outnumnering the opposition's press</p>
            <h5>Defending Style</h5>
            <p>When in possession of the ball Kimmich drops back to form 3ATB , while the other CM covers them  , around 5-6 players crowd one of the flanks which pushes the opposition towards them , this creates space on the other flank which is then exploited by the eagle-eyed midfields who launch the ball forward for mindboggling attacks.</p>
            <h5>Important players</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Robert Lewandoski : all I can is for me he would have won the BallonD'or if it wasnt cancelled</li>
                <li>Thomas Muller: the Raumdeuter has experienced renaissance since Flick took over.</li>
                <li>Joshua Kimmich : arguable the best Right back on the planet</li>
                <li>Alphonso Davies : emergence of the Canadian left back is commendable</li>
                <li>ManWALL Neuer : the name says it all</li>
                <li>The UNDERRATED one : Serge Gnabry cant believe arsenal let him go for 5M euros</li>
            </ul>

            <span class='hcontainer'><h4 class="heading">Pep's Barcelona 2009/10</h4></span>
            <br>
            <p id="quote">"Pep’s almost got a sickness for football" ~ Xavi</p>
            <p>It all started from the appointment of one man Josep Guardiola. Under his reign at Barca , they produced one of the most elegant styles of play the world had ever witnessed . The foundation of the masterpiece is positional play , this is used by Guardiola in every team he manages. Pep doesnt believe in numbers and formations , his players have been trained to use their head before every pass they make, before every action they take .</p>
            <h5>Positional Play</h5>
            <p>In this iconic Barca team every player had a specific role , Valdes played as a sweeper keeper , Puyol and Pique were the ball playing center backs , Alves was the attacking fullback and Abidal played as the third CB. Busquets was the pivot , Xavi dictated the game's tempo he was the orchestrator ,Iniesta played as the attacking midfieder carrying the ball forward ,Pedro played as the winger who sneaked in behind the defence ,  OH ! and Messi's greatness is difficult to put into words.</p>
            <p>Barcelona's midfield was like Mercedes in F1 , their ball retention , intelligence and creativity unmatched , this exceptional level of talent in the center was enough for the wingers to exploit the oppposition fullbacks. Now imagine adding Messi to that midfield as a false Nine , defenders could do nothing but just stand and watch La Pulga dribble past them AND SCORE.</p>
            <p>Barcelona's tactics were simple , high pressing from the wingers and striker made it difficult for the opposition to pass , which forces them to make a mistake , once the opposition drop back its all about quick and constant movement, short, one-touch passing, intelligent positioning and making the correct runs at the right time. One of Barca's greatest ability was ball retention ,keeping it close made it difficult for the opposition to break a pass.</p>
            <p id="quote">I hate tiki-taka. I always will. I want nothing more to do with tiki-taka. Tiki-taka is a load of ****, a made-up term. It means passing the ball for the sake of passing, with no real aim or aggression - nothing. I will not allow my brilliant players to fall for all that rubbish - Josep Guardiola</p>
            <h5 id="end">All this made them the best team of a generation. Forca Barca</h5>

            <span class='hcontainer'><h4 class="heading">Jose's Inter Milan 2010/11</h4></span>
            <p>Mourinho's Inter had a clear idea, dominating your opponents doesn't just mean playing aggressive attacking football or having the most possession, it can also be achieved by smart defending, breaking your opposition's passes, and not letting them create chances to score a goal. Let's talk about a team known for its defensive dominance, let's talk about the Nerazzurri, let's talk about Jose Mourinho's Inter Milan.</p>
            <h5>The Special Way</h5>
            <p>Jose Mourinho set up his team in a 4-2-3-1 formation, Júlio César was the man between the sticks, with club captain Javier Zanetti occupying the left-back spot (also played in the midfield when required), he stayed back being the more defensive fullback, Maicon was an attacking fullback occupying the right flank and every time he bombed forward Cambiasso would cover for him, Maicon excelled in whipping in those low driven crosses for the attackers to pounce upon. </p>
            <p>The center-back pairing of Lucio and Samuel was rock solid. They were more traditional CBs playing mostly short passes to their midfielders instead of launching those long balls but this lack of ball progression was dealt with by the pivot of Cambiasso and Motta/Stankovic. </p>
            <p>Cambiasso was urged to play the balls very quickly so that the attackers could take it to the goalkeeper before the opponents could regroup defensively. The other midfielder in the pivot would be either Stankovic who was more offensive and aided Sneijder or Thiago Motta who was capable of playing in various other midfield positions due to his tactical intelligence and versatility. Once Cambiasso launched the ball forward Sneijder would then use his ability to find Milito or Eto'o(who would drift in as Maicon moved forward).</p>
            <p>Mourinho's side made no urgency in gaining back the ball as they would sit deep and wait for an opportunity to counter-attack clinically.</p>
            <p>Sneijder would also drop back in midfield to overload it and win the ball back which proved to be instrumental in big games, he would dictate the games playing as a CAM. Samuel Eto'o and Pandev played crucial roles in their position, they played as defensive wingers(apart from drifting in when fullbacks joined the attack), they fit into Mourinho's system of play really well at the expense of their attacking prowess. At times even Cristian Chivu would be deployed as a defensive left midfielder. For Diego Milito, I have no words, scored two past Bayern to seal the third UCL title for the Nerazzurri.</p>
            <p id="quote">“It’s not important how we play. If you have a Ferrari and I have a small car, to beat you in a race I have to break your wheel or put sugar in your tank.” - The Special One</p>
            <h5 id="end">Under Mourinho, Inter controlled the games defensively, they were arguably one of the best Italian sides. With the Scudetto, Copa Italia, and UCL in the bag, Inter became the first Italian team to complete the treble. Offense wins you matches and defense wins you titles.</h5>
