Formation : 433, **When in possession** Real Madrid would dominate their opponents outside the area, using Modric's and Kroos's vision and passing to switch the ball from side to side, to set the fullbacks getting behind defences, this would let the front three of Bale-Benzema-Ronaldo to crowd the penalty area and then receive a cross from either of the fullbacks or give through balls to the likes of Ronaldo or Gareth Bale, who would then get behind the defenders and set up a teammate for a goal. Players would be very patient during the build-up, which would draw the opponents towards them and force them to make a mistake which would then be exploited by the front three.

**When out of possession/ when they lose the ball**: The team would apply pressure usually centrally. If the press failed the team would drop back in their own half, having a formation of 4-5-1, flooding the midfield and once the possession was regained Bale and Ronaldo would use their explosive speed for counter attacks with Benzema making some crucial passes (linking up the play), along with the attackers one of the fullbacks would come in to support.

Madrid had the same midfield in all the three CL finals (2016,17,18), Casemiro (to me he is the best defensive midfielder) dominating in the big games, he helps Madrid in sitting deep, breaking up the play, and start the counter-attacks, because of the attacking nature of the full-backs Casemiro ensured that the opposition doesn't counter-attack.

Modric, the link man, he applies pressure from the front, he would keep the passes short and effective and this would prove to be destructive in the final third. He linked Madrid's midfield and their attack. Dribbling was his main asset, and he can use it to help his side beat an opposition press and then feed the attack.

Toni Kroos would control the tempo of the game, with him being the orchestrator of many attacks. Kroosâ€™ passing range and accuracy are very impressive. He would arrive late around the penalty area and bend it in the corners for a goal.

Sergio Ramos would break the play, and his ability to defend 1on1 is exceptional. Ramos covers depth in standard situations with ease, constantly manipulating his defensive positioning in slight ways to the tune of his surroundings. A man to mark in case of set pieces, Ramos' bullet headers are pinpoint.

Carvajal and Marcelo both played vital roles in the success of this side. Because they are both dangerous in the attacking third, their presence naturally opens on space for players like Isco, Bale, and Ronaldo to exploit. Marcelo is a complete fullback with excellent dribbling, very athletic, and has great ball control.

The trio of Bale, Benzema, and Ronaldo would give nightmares to defenders with their ruthless goal-scoring ability. Benzema would drop in as a false nine giving CR7 and Bale the space to exploit defenders, Bale would use his raw pace and acceleration to ease past the defence, and to explain what the GOAT does in a few words is a difficult task. He would turn on the beast mode in big matches, his ability to step up in big games is unmatched.

What Real achieved in those years is a feat difficult to replicate, it probably won't be repeated for many years. Zidane had a winning formula, his tactics were simple with the greatest team ever.
