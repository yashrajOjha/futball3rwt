During Kovac's time at Bayern , the team scored 2.67 and conceded 1.43 goals per 90' , it was arguably the worst Bayern side in history. Following his sacking We have seen the German giants score 3.19 and concede 0.85 goals per 90. OOF ! and all the credits go to one man Hansi Flick.

- While attacking AD moves further up the pitch(LW) while the other full back plays as a RWB, who rushes forward only when needed , the wingers play as CAMs just behind the striker , this means there are 5 Attackers in or around the box , one of the midfielder stays on the edge of the box as a cover.  This flexible positioning helps in effective high pressing thus outnumnering the opposition's press
- When in possession of the ball Kimmich drops back to form 3ATB , while the other CM covers them  , around 5-6 players crowd one of the flanks which pushes the opposition towards them , this creates space on the other flank which is then exploited by the eagle-eyed midfields who launch the ball forward for mindboggling attacks.
- Best Players :
1. Robert Lewandoski : all I can is for me he would have won the BallonD'or if it wasnt cancelled.
2. Thomas Muller: the Raumdeuter has experienced renaissance since Flick took over.
3. Joshua Kimmich : arguable the best Right back on the planet
4. Alphonso Davies : emergence of the Canadian left back is commendable
5. ManWALL Neuer : the name says it all
